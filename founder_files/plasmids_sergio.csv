pSR351,KS cdr2 (S476D S632D),Mutagenesis on pSR189 to introduces the S632D mutation
pSR352,pFA6a cdr2 (S476D S632D)-mEGFP,Cdr2 (S476D S632D) was amplified from pSR351 with oligos containing BamHI and PacI sites and cloned into pSR20
pSR353,pGEX6p-Cdr2 peptide S476S,"Oligos containing the sequence corresponding to Cdr2 (S471 to S480) and the overhanging sequence for BamHI and SalI were annealed and ligated into a pGEX6p previously digested with BamHI and SalI, not dephosphorylated"
pSR354,pGEX6p-Cdr2 peptide S476A,"Oligos containing the sequence corresponding to Cdr2 (S471 to S480), with the mutation S476A and the overhanging sequence for BamHI and SalI were annealed and ligated into a pGEX6p previously digested with BamHI and SalI, not dephosphorylated"
pSR355,pGEX6p-Cdr2 peptide S632S,"Oligos containing the sequence corresponding to Cdr2 (R628 to K638) and the overhanging sequence for BamHI and SalI were annealed and ligated into a pGEX6p previously digested with BamHI and SalI, not dephosphorylated"
