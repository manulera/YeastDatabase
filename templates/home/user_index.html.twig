Hello {{ app.user.username }}, welcome to your collection!
<div class="mt-3 alert alert-info" role="alert">
<h5>Read before going further</h5>
    <p>This is a proof of concept demo to showcase how you can browse a <i>S. pombe</i> strain collection in which we keep track of the
    origin of alleles and strains, so that you can quickly access all strains that have a certain allele, the ancestry and progeny of a strain, etc.</p>
    <p>In this demo, when you create a new allele you select tags, markers, promoters and / or
    sequence mutations manually, and the resources (plasmids and oligos) that you used for a genetic modification.</p>
    <p>In the real app, you will select the locus or genome position where a change is made, the plasmid and/or oligos used, and the transformation method.
    Then, the resulting allele sequence will be generated automatically, and the tags, markers, etc. will be directly populated.
    You can see a prototype of the interface to simulate cloning at
